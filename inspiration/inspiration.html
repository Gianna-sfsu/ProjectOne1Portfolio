        <h4>all of his works are very inspirational to me I would love to create illustrations like this and it <br>
            inspired me to challenge my design 
        skills and focus more on illustrations which is one thing I lack as a designer.  </h4>

        <h4> she inspires me with her use of bright colors and simple designs, 
            like in her work for the Google I/O 2025 stickers, Coolhaus brand packaging, 
            and <br>Pet Plate brand packaging. i love how she combines bold colors with clean, 
            minimal designs to create something eye-catching and fun but still professional. <br>
            her work shows me that simplicity can be powerful and encourages me to use vibrant colors and straightforward designs in my projects to make them stand out.</h4>
