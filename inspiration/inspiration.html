            <a href="https://www.artofhartline.com/" class="artist-link">AARON J. HARTLINE</a>
            <img src="img/hartline.png" alt="Aaron J. Hartline Artwork">
            <h4>All of his works are very inspirational to me. I would love to create illustrations like this, and it inspired me to challenge my design skills and focus more on illustrations, which is one thing I lack as a designer. Aaron J. Hartline inspires me because he brings together emotion, creativity, and skill in his illustrations.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="artist">
            <a href="https://andwalsh.com/" class="artist-link">JESSICA WALSH</a>
            <img src="img/walsh.png" alt="Jessica Walsh Artwork">
            <h4>Jessica Walsh inspires me with her use of bright colors and simple designs, such as Coolhaus brand packaging. I love how she combines bold colors with clean, minimal designs to create something eye-catching and fun but still professional. Her work shows me that simplicity can be powerful.</h4>

            <a href="https://spidershoodies.com/" class="artist-link">JEFFERY WILLIAMS</a>
            <img src="img/williams.png" alt="Jeffery Williams Clothing Brand">
            <h4>Jeffery Williams, also known as Young Thug, inspires me with his clothing brand, Spider. His shirts, hoodies, and sweats stand out with their bright colors and cool designs, mixing streetwear with high fashion. I admire how he uses his brand to show his personality and break fashion rules.</h4>
