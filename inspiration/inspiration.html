                <h4>All of his works are very inspirational to me I would love to create illustrations like this and it inspired me to challenge my design skills and focus more on illustrations which is one thing I lack as a designer. 
        
                  Aaron J. Hartline inspires me because he brings together emotion, creativity, and skill in his illustrations.
                   His work on projects shows how he can create characters 
                  that are both visually striking and emotionally relatable. 
                 I admire how he captures feelings through different styles, whether it's through colorful 
                    animations or simple sketches. </h4>

                <h4> Jessica Walsh inspires me with her use of bright colors and simple designs, Coolhaus brand packaging. I love how she combines bold colors with clean, minimal designs to create something eye-catching and fun but still professional. 
                    Her work shows me that simplicity can be powerful and encourages me to use vibrant colors and straightforward designs in my projects to make them stand out.</h4>

                <img src="img/williams.png" alt="jeffery williams clothing brand">
                <h4> Jeffery Williams, also known as Young Thug, inspires me with his clothing brand, Spider. His shirts, hoodies, and sweats stand out with their bright colors and cool designs, mixing streetwear with high fashion.
                     I admire how he uses his brand to show his personality and break fashion rules. 
                     His bold use of color and style encourages me to be more creative with my designs. 
                    Spider gets its name from Thuggerâ€™s love for spiders, featuring spider webs prominently, and often includes the angel number 555 in its designs, sometimes even as Sp5der.</h4>
