            I grew up in San Francisco, where I lived until I finished high school. After graduation, 
            I moved to the East Bay to start my first year of college at San Francisco State University. 
            Moving away from the city I had known my whole life was a big adjustment, 
            but the change has been exciting and opened new opportunities. I come from a family of three brothers, 
            and I'm the only girl, which always made for an interesting dynamic growing up.
            A big part of my life right now is my one-year-old Rottweiler, Champ. 
            I'm excited about applying what I've learned to my future projects.
